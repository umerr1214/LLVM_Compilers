# Compiler Using Flex, Bison, LLVM, and MLIR

This project is created and executed on **Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS**. It uses **Flex 2.6.4**, **GNU Bison 3.8.2**, **LLVM**, and **MLIR**. The project should work on other operating systems and software versions, but no guarantees are provided.

The videos explaining every aspect of this project are available on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxP0p--aBHmL5uj9eecRFLIm1Qx2T8_sx&si=LvvqhGXqyp8faGQG).

## Project Organization

The project is organized into the following folders:

1. **`ssc-flex-bison`**:
   - Contains code for the **Simple Simple C (SSC)** compiler using **Flex** and **Bison**.
   - This version does **not** generate LLVM intermediate code.
   - Focuses on lexical analysis, parsing, and semantic analysis.

2. **`ssc-flex-bison-llvm`**:
   - Extends the SSC compiler to generate **LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR)**.
   - Uses **LLVM** for code generation and optimization.
   - Includes support for **MLIR** (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) for advanced optimizations and transformations.

---

## Requirements

- **Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS** or a similar Linux distribution.
- **Flex 2.6.4**.
- **GNU Bison 3.8.2**.
- **Clang++** (for compiling the compiler).
- **LLVM** (for intermediate code generation and optimization).
- **MLIR** (optional, for advanced optimizations).

---

## Compilation and Execution

### Navigating to the Directory

Before running any commands, make sure to navigate to the appropriate directory where the `Makefile` is located. For example:

```bash
cd ssc-flex-bison
```

or

```bash
cd ssc-flex-bison-llvm
```

---

### Compiling the Compiler

To compile the SSC compiler, use the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will generate the executable for the SSC compiler using Flex, Bison, and (if applicable) LLVM.

---

### Running the Compiler

To run the compiler with a sample input file (`input.ssc`), use:

```bash
make run
```

This command will compile the SSC code and output the results.

---

### Optimizing with LLVM (ssc-flex-bison-llvm only)

To generate and run the compiler with **optimized LLVM IR**, use:

```bash
make run_opt
```

This will:
1. Generate LLVM IR (`output.ll`).
2. Optimize the IR using `opt` (`output_opt.ll`).
3. Compile the optimized IR into an executable and run it.

---

### Cleaning Up

To remove compiled and intermediate files, run:

```bash
make clean
```

To remove all generated files, including the output executable, run:

```bash
make distclean
```

---

### Help

To see the available `Makefile` commands, run:

```bash
make help
```

---

## Files in the Project

### **ssc-flex-bison Folder**

- **`ssc.l`**: The Flex file for the lexical analyzer.
- **`ssc.y`**: The Bison file for the syntax and semantic analyzer.
- **`IR.h`**: The header file containing all the C/C++ code.
- **`input.ssc`**: A sample input file containing Simple Simple C code to test the compiler.

---

### **ssc-flex-bison-llvm Folder**

- **`ssc.l`**: The Flex file for the lexical analyzer.
- **`ssc.y`**: The Bison file for the syntax and semantic analyzer.
- **`IR.h`**: The header file containing all the C/C++ code, including LLVM IR generation.
- **`input.ssc`**: A sample input file containing Simple Simple C code to test the compiler.
- **`output.ll`**: The generated LLVM IR file.
- **`output_opt.ll`**: The optimized LLVM IR file (generated using `opt`).

---

## Key Features

### **ssc-flex-bison**
- Lexical analysis using **Flex**.
- Syntax and semantic analysis using **Bison**.
- Simple code generation without LLVM.

### **ssc-flex-bison-llvm**
- Lexical analysis using **Flex**.
- Syntax and semantic analysis using **Bison**.
- **LLVM IR generation**: The compiler generates LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) for the input code.
- **Optimization**: The LLVM IR can be optimized using the `opt` tool.
- **MLIR integration**: Advanced optimizations and transformations using MLIR (optional).

## Example Workflow

### For `ssc-flex-bison`:
1. Navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd ssc-flex-bison
   ```
2. Compile the compiler:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. Run the compiler:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

### For `ssc-flex-bison-llvm`:
1. Navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd ssc-flex-bison-llvm
   ```
2. Compile the compiler:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. Run the compiler with unoptimized IR:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```
4. Run the compiler with optimized IR:
   ```bash
   make run_opt
   ```

## Notes

- Ensure that you are in the correct directory (`ssc-flex-bison` or `ssc-flex-bison-llvm`) before running any commands. Each folder has its own `Makefile` and files necessary for compilation and execution.
- The `ssc-flex-bison-llvm` folder requires LLVM and MLIR to be installed on your system.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with LLVM IR generation or optimization, ensure that LLVM is installed correctly and that the `opt` tool is available in your system's PATH.
- For MLIR-related issues, ensure that MLIR is properly configured and linked with your project.
